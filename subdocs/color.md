## Intro
Welcome to the documentation of the Color add-on! 🌈

Many different color formats exist, each with its own conventions.
To avoid confusion, this add-on standardizes everything on hex colors,
just like the Wokki Chat API.

Since hex values can be inconvenient to write by hand, the add-on
provides a simple method to convert RGB(A) values and color names
into hex format.
